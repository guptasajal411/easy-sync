# 🧐 What's the stack?
- Frontend: Basic HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I have used jQuery for keeping the library simple and responsive.
- Backend: Node.js & Express.js for creating new routes, handling GET, POST & DELETE requests, and performing CRUD operations on databases.
- Database: I have used MongoDB Atlas for remote database, and Mongoose for modelling the application data.
- One schema & collection, each user has `username`, `password` & an array of bookmarks
- Deployed on Heroku! - https://try-easy-sync.herokuapp.com/
